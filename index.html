    <section id="section-a"><p>Mount Everest, the world's highest peak above sea level, stands majestically in the Mahalangur Himalayas, straddling the border between Nepal and China (Tibet Autonomous Region). Its summit, reaching 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), has captivated explorers and mountaineers for centuries. The allure of conquering this formidable giant draws climbers from around the globe, each facing extreme conditions, including thin air, freezing temperatures, and unpredictable weather. The mountain holds immense cultural and spiritual significance for local Sherpa communities, who revere it as Chomolungma, the "Mother Goddess of the World." Its icy slopes and snow-capped peak remain an enduring symbol of human ambition and the raw power of nature.</p></section>

Its jagged ridges and glacial valleys carve a dramatic landscape against the azure sky. The journey to its summit is fraught with peril, demanding meticulous planning, specialized equipment, and unwavering determination. Base camps on both the Nepalese and Tibetan sides serve as bustling hubs of activity during climbing seasons. The mountain's glaciers are a vital source of water for downstream communities, highlighting its ecological importance.
